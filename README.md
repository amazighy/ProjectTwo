# Using React (Hooks) with D3 - [15] Stacked Area Chart

This is the code of the video tutorial series "Using React (Hooks) with D3".

Each tutorial session is saved within a branch,
so if you wanna work with the code from this repo, checkout the branches!

This session is follow-up to creating stacked bar charts, but this time, we are using areas instead of bars.

## Getting Started

`git clone git@github.com:muratkemaldar/using-react-hooks-with-d3.git`

`git checkout 15-stacked-area-chart`

`npm install`

`npm start`
